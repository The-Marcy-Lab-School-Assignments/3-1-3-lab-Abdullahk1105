# Question

What are at least 2 benefits to using:

```html
<script type="module" src="index.js"></script>
```

Instead of:

```html
<script src="index.js"></script>
```

# Answer

1.We can import and export code across different files, this is really useful because, this allows us to bring in helper functions from other files, making it easier to write code by reusing existing functions.

2. We can import CSS and HTML files in JavaScript. This helps us because we can use css to style our websites to make them look nicer, and cleaner, while at the same time we can use html and javascript to make our sites more functional.
