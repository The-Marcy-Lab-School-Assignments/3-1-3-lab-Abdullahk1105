# Question

When we say "use semantic elements," what does that mean?

Please be sure to give an example of a semantic and non-semantic element in your explanation.

# Answer

A semantic element clearly tells both the browser and the developer what its purpose is. These elements make our webpage easier to understand and maintain because they organize content in a way we can understand as if we were just looking at english definitions. Some examples of semantic elements are <header> , <main> , <footer>. Some examples of non-semantic elements are <div> and <span> because they tell us nothing about its content.
